# Progress reports split-up

- DOC/DOCX format progress reports should be prepared and delivered as scheduled. The progress report will include an analysis of the activity performed in the relevant time frame.
- Have in mind that this course is part of the final semester, with a length of 12 weeks, and the last day of the semester is the Friday of the 12-th week.
- The grading will be finalised on that day. This does not mean the thesis to be final by the end of the 12-th week, but that the process of elaboration of the thesis is continuous and documented accordingly.
- From the point of view of submissions, the week ends Friday at 6pm, as specified in the reports' deadlines.
- According to the syllabus, the submission delay penalties are of 1 (one) point per (part of) calendar week; holiday weeks inside the semester do not count.
